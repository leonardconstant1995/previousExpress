## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node

My focus on this application fully went to transfering my previously made palindrome application and making it function server side. This was accomplished by basically moving what the original application's main.js was doing and putting it within my server.js's app.post section.

## Lessons Learned:

Pathing everything can be a bit confusing. This application was thankfully smaller so there was little to no hassle. With bigger applications it may be a little troublesome.
